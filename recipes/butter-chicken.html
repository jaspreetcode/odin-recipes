        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Butter chicken is an indian recipe which is quite similar to chicken curry but different in taste.</p>
        <p>As the name suggests, its main ingredient is butter and that makes it a mouth-watering dish.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup butter, divided</li>
            <li>1 onion, minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
            <li>3 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
            <li>1 Â½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast, cut into bite-sized chunks</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons tandoori masala</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in onion and garlic, and cook slowly until the onion caramelizes to a dark brown, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, combine cream, tomato sauce, remaining butter, salt, cayenne pepper, and garam masala in a saucepan over medium-high heat; bring to a simmer.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. Stir in caramelized onions.</li>
            <li>While the sauce is simmering, toss chicken with vegetable oil until coated. Season with tandoori masala and spread out onto a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 12 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add cooked chicken to the sauce and simmer for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
